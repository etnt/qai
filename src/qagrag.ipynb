However, these models primarily rely on system one thinking, which is fast and intuitive but lacks the ability to break down complex problems into smaller steps and explore different options. This limitation has led researchers to focus on developing GPT-5 with enhanced reasoning abilities and reliability.The Two Modes of ThinkingIn his book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" Daniel Kahneman introduces the concept of two modes of thinking: system one and system two. System one thinking is our fast, intuitive brain that quickly provides answers based on memorized information. On the other hand, system two thinking is slower but more rational, requiring us to take time, calculate, and analyze before arriving at an answer.Similarly, large language models like GPT-4 primarily rely on system one thinking. They predict the best next words based on the sequence of words they have seen before, without truly understanding the complex problems they are trying to solve.\\u200dThe Limitations of GPT-4GPT-4, despite its impressive capabilities, lacks system two thinking. It cannot break down complex tasks into smaller steps or explore different options. It simply generates text based on patterns it has learned from training data. This limitation becomes evident when GPT-4 is faced with complex problems that require deeper analysis and reasoning.For example, in a video by Veritasium, college students were asked seemingly simple questions like the time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun. Many of them answered incorrectly because they relied on system one thinking, providing automatic intuitive answers without truly considering the question.Large language models like GPT-4 face a similar challenge. They lack the ability to think critically and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. This is where GPT-5 comes in.The Promise of GPT-5GPT-5 aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models and introduce system two thinking. OpenAI\\'s Sam Altman mentioned in an interview with Bill Gates that the key milestones for GPT-5 will be around reasoning ability and reliability.Currently, GPT-4 can reason in extremely limited ways and lacks reliability. It may provide correct answers, but it doesn\\'t always know which answer is the best. GPT-5 aims to improve this by increasing reliability and enhancing reasoning abilities.Altman also mentioned the possibility of GPT-5 being able to solve complex math equations by applying transformations an arbitrary number of times. This would require a more complex control logic for reasoning, going beyond what is currently possible with GPT-4.However, simply improving the model itself is not enough. There are ways to enforce system two thinking in large language models today, even with GPT-4.Promoting System 2 Thinking in Large Language ModelsThere are two common strategies to promote system two thinking in large language models: prompt engineering and communicative agents.Prompt EngineeringPrompt engineering is a simple and common method to guide large language models towards system two thinking. One approach is the \"chain of thought,\" where a sentence is inserted step by step before the model generates any text. This forces the model to break down the problem into smaller steps and think through each one.Another approach is to provide a few short prompt examples instead of a step-by-step process. These examples guide the model towards thinking through different steps and considering multiple possibilities.While prompt engineering can be effective in promoting system two thinking, it has limitations. It often restricts the model to consider only one possibility and may not explore diverse options, similar to how humans approach creative problem-solving.To address this limitation, more advanced prompting tactics like self-consistency with chain of thought (SCCOT) have been proposed. SCCOT involves running the chain of thought process multiple times and reviewing and voting on the most reasonable answers. This allows for some exploration of different options but requires more implementation effort.Another advanced prompting tactic is the tree of sorts, which simulates a tree search to explore different options and paths. It keeps track of all the paths explored and allows for backtracking if the current path doesn\\'t lead to the desired outcome. However, implementing the tree of sorts is complex and requires significant implementation effort.Communicative AgentsCommunicative agents provide an elegant solution to promote system two thinking in large language models. These are multi-agent setups where users can define different agents and simulate conversations between them. The agents can reflect and spot flaws in each other\\'s perspectives and thinking processes.Communicative agents have shown promise in enhancing system two thinking. They allow for dedicated agents to review and critique the model\\'s answers, identifying flaws and providing feedback. This collaborative approach mimics how humans solve complex problems by exploring multiple options and learning from each other.Setting up communicative agents can be done using various frameworks like ChatGPT, MetaGPT, Autogen, and Crew AI. These frameworks enable the creation of agent workflows and facilitate conversations between agents with different roles, such as problem solvers and reviewers.Autogen Studio, a no-code interface for Autogen, simplifies the setup of communicative agent workflows. It allows for easy collaboration and problem-solving between agents, making it accessible to a wider range of users.Unlocking System 2 Thinking with GPT-4 TodayWhile GPT-4 may not have native system two thinking capabilities, prompt engineering and communicative agents can be used to enforce system two thinking and solve complex tasks.Prompt engineering, such as the chain of thought or self-consistency with chain of thought, guides the model towards thinking through problems step by step and considering multiple possibilities. However, prompt engineering may limit exploration and diversity of solutions.Communicative agents, on the other hand, provide a collaborative approach to problem-solving. By simulating conversations between agents, users can leverage the strengths of system one and system two thinking. Reviewers can spot flaws in the model\\'s answers, while problem solvers can iterate and improve their solutions based on feedback.Frameworks like Autogen Studio make it easy to set up communicative agent workflows, allowing for seamless collaboration and problem-solving.The Future of GPT-5 and System 2 ThinkingGPT-5 holds the promise of unlocking system two thinking in large language models. With enhanced reasoning abilities and reliability, GPT-5 aims to bridge the gap between system one and system two thinking, enabling models to solve complex problems more effectively.Researchers are actively working on developing GPT-5 with improved reasoning abilities. The focus is on enabling large language models to break down complex tasks, explore different options, and make more accurate and informed decisions.As we look forward to the advancements in GPT-5, it\\'s important to continue exploring and implementing strategies like prompt engineering and communicative agents to drive system two thinking in large language models today.\\u200dFollow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/jasonzhou1993\\u200dFAQs1.

If so, you may be facing the challenge of high costs associated with large language models (LLM). In this article, we will explore effective strategies to reduce LLM costs by up to 78%. Let's dive in!\\u200d1. Change ModelOne effective way to reduce LLM costs is to change the model you are using. Different models have different costs associated with them. For example, GPT-4 is the most powerful but also the most expensive model, while Mistro 7B is significantly cheaper. By using a smaller model for specific tasks and reserving the more expensive model for complex questions, you can achieve significant cost savings.2. Large Language Model RouterThe concept of a large language model router involves using a cascade of models to handle different types of questions. Cheaper models are used first, and if they are unable to provide a satisfactory answer, the question is passed on to a more expensive model. This approach leverages the significant cost difference between models and can result in substantial cost savings.3. Multi-Agent SetupAnother strategy is to set up multiple agents, each using a different model. The first agent attempts to complete the task using a cheaper model, and if it fails, the next agent is invoked. By using this multi-agent setup, you can achieve similar or even better success rates while significantly reducing costs.4. LLM LinguaLLM Lingua is a method introduced by Microsoft that focuses on optimizing the input and output of large language models. By removing unnecessary tokens and words from the input, you can significantly reduce the cost of running the model. This method is particularly effective for tasks such as summarization or answering specific questions based on a transcript.5. Optimize Agent MemoryOptimizing agent memory is another way to reduce LLM costs. By carefully managing the amount of conversation history stored in memory, you can minimize the number of tokens required for each interaction. This can lead to significant cost savings, especially when dealing with long conversations.6. ObservabilityHaving a deep understanding of the cost patterns in your LLM application is crucial for effective cost optimization. By using observability platforms like L Smith, you can monitor and log the cost for each large language model. This allows you to identify areas where costs can be optimized and make informed decisions to reduce overall expenses.By implementing these strategies, you can reduce LLM costs by up to 78% or more. Remember, reducing costs while maintaining performance and user experience is a critical skill for AI startups. Stay proactive and continuously optimize your LLM usage to maximize efficiency and profitability.\\u200dGet free HubSpot AI For Marketers Course: https://clickhubspot.com/xut🔗 LinksFollow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/jasonzhou1993Join my AI email list: https://crafters.ai/My discord: https://discord.gg/eZXprSaCDEInbox Agent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv_e6Rt4vWE&t=23s&ab_channel=AIJasonResearch Agent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogQUlS7CkYA&t=299s&ab_channel=AIJasonJames Brigg on Agent Memory: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-conversational-memory/Another video about details for LLM cost tracking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alb2kjUzpZ8&ab_channel=LearnfromOpenSourcewithElie\\u200dFrequently Asked QuestionsQ: How can I determine which model is the most cost-effective for my AI application?A: To determine the most cost-effective model for your AI application, you should consider the specific tasks and requirements of your application. Evaluate the performance and cost trade-offs of different models and choose the one that best fits your needs.Q: Are there any open-source solutions available for large language model routing?A: While there are no specific open-source solutions for large language model routing, you can explore frameworks like Hugging Face's Hugging GPT, which allows you to build your own routing logic using a large language model as a controller.Q: How often should I monitor and optimize my LLM costs?A: It is recommended to monitor and optimize your LLM costs regularly, especially as your usage and user base grow.

With the latest advancements in AI development, it is now possible to create a group of AI researchers that can work together to extract data, conduct high-quality research, and deliver accurate results. In this step-by-step tutorial, I will show you how to build a multi-agent research system using GPT assistants and Autogen framework. Let's dive in!IntroductionAre you tired of spending hours conducting research and compiling data? Do you wish you had a team of AI researchers that could assist you in extracting information and delivering high-quality research results? Look no further! In this tutorial, I will guide you through the process of building a multi-agent research system using GPT assistants and the Autogen framework. With this system, you can automate your research tasks and improve the quality and efficiency of your work.BackgroundBefore we dive into the details of building the research system, let's first understand the background and the motivation behind it. Research is a fundamental ability that AI can excel at, and it has a wide range of use cases. Over the past few years, AI development has been rapidly evolving, and new AI researchers with enhanced capabilities are being built regularly. These researchers can perform tasks such as conducting Google searches, browsing the internet, and generating reports based on the collected information.AI Researcher 2.0The initial version of the AI researcher, which we will refer to as AI Researcher 2.0, followed a linear process. It was a simple language model chain that could take a research topic as input, trigger a Google search, scrape relevant websites, and generate a report. While this version worked for simple research tasks, it had limitations. For example, if new information was found during the content scraping process, the researcher couldn't further research it. Additionally, it struggled with complex or constrained actions.Multi-Agent SystemsTo overcome the limitations of AI Researcher 2.0, multi-agent systems were introduced. These systems, such as MGBT and Chaddef, allowed multiple agents to work together to tackle more complex tasks. The Autogen framework made it easier to create and orchestrate the collaboration between different agents. With the introduction of the Assistant API and GBS by OpenAI, building useful agents became more accessible and cost-effective.Fine-TuningWhen training highly specialized agents, there are two common approaches: fine-tuning and knowledge base creation. Fine-tuning is used when you want to improve the model's skills in performing specific tasks, such as data categorization or answering customer emails. Gradient AI is a platform that simplifies the fine-tuning process and makes it accessible to all developers and enterprises. With Gradient AI, you can fine-tune high-performance open-source models without the need for specialized hardware or upfront infrastructure costs.Building the Research SystemNow that we have a clear understanding of the background and the tools at our disposal, let's start building the research system. We will create three different GPT assistants with different roles: the user proxy agent, the researcher, and the research manager. Each assistant will play a specific role in the research process, and we will use the Autogen framework to orchestrate their collaboration.Creating the Research AgentsThe first step is to create the research agents. We will start by creating the researcher agent, which will be responsible for browsing the internet and conducting research tasks. The researcher agent will be a GPT assistant with the ability to extract detailed information on any given topic and produce fact-based results. It will perform Google searches, script websites, and provide research references.Next, we will create the research manager agent. The research manager will review the results from the researcher and provide feedback and quality control. The research manager will generate research plans, review the research delivered by the researcher, and propose alternative methods if necessary. The research manager plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the research results.Finally, we will create the director agent. The director will extract a list of companies to research from an Air table and break it down into individual research tasks. The director will delegate these tasks to the research manager and the researcher. Once a company's research is completed, the director will update the company information in the Air table. The director agent ensures that the research tasks are organized and completed efficiently.Connecting the AgentsNow that we have created the research agents, it's time to connect them together using the Autogen framework. Autogen simplifies the usage of the Assistant API by providing a straightforward way to trigger messages and track progress. We will define the user proxy agent, the researcher agent, and the research manager agent. We will then create a group chat and add the agents to the chat. This will allow them to communicate and collaborate effectively.Expanding the SystemOne of the most exciting aspects of the research system is its ability to expand and accommodate more agents. You can introduce additional agents, such as a research director, who can break down large research goals into subtasks and delegate them to the research manager and the researcher. The system can also include agents with additional capabilities, such as reading and writing to an Air table to save research results. By expanding the system with more agents, you can enhance its capabilities and make it more autonomous.Training Specialized AgentsTraining specialized agents is crucial for improving the performance of the research system. There are two common approaches to training specialized agents: fine-tuning and knowledge base creation. Fine-tuning is used when you want to improve the model's skills in performing specific tasks.

       " Document(page_content='GPT5 unlocks LLM System 2 Thinking?AI JASONCategories\\ue80fAI AgentAI Automation TutorialsLangchain TutorialsAuto GPT TutorialsContact\\ue82e\\ue829\\ue819AI AgentGPT5 unlocks LLM System 2 Thinking?\\nGPT5 unlocks LLM System 2 Thinking?AI has come a long way in recent years, with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 impressing us with their ability to generate text. However, these models primarily rely on system one thinking, which is fast and intuitive but lacks the ability to break down complex problems into smaller steps and explore different options. This limitation has led researchers to focus on developing GPT-5 with enhanced reasoning abilities and reliability.The Two Modes of ThinkingIn his book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" Daniel Kahneman introduces the concept of two modes of thinking: system one and system two. System one thinking is our fast, intuitive brain that quickly provides answers based on memorized information. On the other hand, system two thinking is slower but more rational, requiring us to take time, calculate, and analyze before arriving at an answer.Similarly, large language models like GPT-4 primarily rely on system one thinking. They predict the best next words based on the sequence of words they have seen before, without truly understanding the complex problems they are trying to solve.\\u200dThe Limitations of GPT-4GPT-4, despite its impressive capabilities, lacks system two thinking. It cannot break down complex tasks into smaller steps or explore different options. It simply generates text based on patterns it has learned from training data. This limitation becomes evident when GPT-4 is faced with complex problems that require deeper analysis and reasoning.For example, in a video by Veritasium, college students were asked seemingly simple questions like the time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun. Many of them answered incorrectly because they relied on system one thinking, providing automatic intuitive answers without truly considering the question.Large language models like GPT-4 face a similar challenge. They lack the ability to think critically and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. This is where GPT-5 comes in.The Promise of GPT-5GPT-5 aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models and introduce system two thinking. OpenAI\\'s Sam Altman mentioned in an interview with Bill Gates that the key milestones for GPT-5 will be around reasoning ability and reliability.Currently, GPT-4 can reason in extremely limited ways and lacks reliability. It may provide correct answers, but it doesn\\'t always know which answer is the best. GPT-5 aims to improve this by increasing reliability and enhancing reasoning abilities.Altman also mentioned the possibility of GPT-5 being able to solve complex math equations by applying transformations an arbitrary number of times. This would require a more complex control logic for reasoning, going beyond what is currently possible with GPT-4.However, simply improving the model itself is not enough. There are ways to enforce system two thinking in large language models today, even with GPT-4.Promoting System 2 Thinking in Large Language ModelsThere are two common strategies to promote system two thinking in large language models: prompt engineering and communicative agents.Prompt EngineeringPrompt engineering is a simple and common method to guide large language models towards system two thinking. One approach is the \"chain of thought,\" where a sentence is inserted step by step before the model generates any text. This forces the model to break down the problem into smaller steps and think through each one.Another approach is to provide a few short prompt examples instead of a step-by-step process. These examples guide the model towards thinking through different steps and considering multiple possibilities.While prompt engineering can be effective in promoting system two thinking, it has limitations. It often restricts the model to consider only one possibility and may not explore diverse options, similar to how humans approach creative problem-solving.To address this limitation, more advanced prompting tactics like self-consistency with chain of thought (SCCOT) have been proposed. SCCOT involves running the chain of thought process multiple times and reviewing and voting on the most reasonable answers. This allows for some exploration of different options but requires more implementation effort.Another advanced prompting tactic is the tree of sorts, which simulates a tree search to explore different options and paths. It keeps track of all the paths explored and allows for backtracking if the current path doesn\\'t lead to the desired outcome. However, implementing the tree of sorts is complex and requires significant implementation effort.Communicative AgentsCommunicative agents provide an elegant solution to promote system two thinking in large language models. These are multi-agent setups where users can define different agents and simulate conversations between them. The agents can reflect and spot flaws in each other\\'s perspectives and thinking processes.Communicative agents have shown promise in enhancing system two thinking. They allow for dedicated agents to review and critique the model\\'s answers, identifying flaws and providing feedback. This collaborative approach mimics how humans solve complex problems by exploring multiple options and learning from each other.Setting up communicative agents can be done using various frameworks like ChatGPT, MetaGPT, Autogen, and Crew AI. These frameworks enable the creation of agent workflows and facilitate conversations between agents with different roles, such as problem solvers and reviewers.Autogen Studio, a no-code interface for Autogen, simplifies the setup of communicative agent workflows. It allows for easy collaboration and problem-solving between agents, making it accessible to a wider range of users.Unlocking System 2 Thinking with GPT-4 TodayWhile GPT-4 may not have native system two thinking capabilities, prompt engineering and communicative agents can be used to enforce system two thinking and solve complex tasks.Prompt engineering, such as the chain of thought or self-consistency with chain of thought, guides the model towards thinking through problems step by step and considering multiple possibilities. However, prompt engineering may limit exploration and diversity of solutions.Communicative agents, on the other hand, provide a collaborative approach to problem-solving. By simulating conversations between agents, users can leverage the strengths of system one and system two thinking. Reviewers can spot flaws in the model\\'s answers, while problem solvers can iterate and improve their solutions based on feedback.Frameworks like Autogen Studio make it easy to set up communicative agent workflows, allowing for seamless collaboration and problem-solving.The Future of GPT-5 and System 2 ThinkingGPT-5 holds the promise of unlocking system two thinking in large language models. With enhanced reasoning abilities and reliability, GPT-5 aims to bridge the gap between system one and system two thinking, enabling models to solve complex problems more effectively.Researchers are actively working on developing GPT-5 with improved reasoning abilities. The focus is on enabling large language models to break down complex tasks, explore different options, and make more accurate and informed decisions.As we look forward to the advancements in GPT-5, it\\'s important to continue exploring and implementing strategies like prompt engineering and communicative agents to drive system two thinking in large language models today.\\u200dFollow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/jasonzhou1993\\u200dFAQs1.

With the latest advancements in AI development, it is now possible to create a group of AI researchers that can work together to extract data, conduct high-quality research, and deliver accurate results. In this step-by-step tutorial, I will show you how to build a multi-agent research system using GPT assistants and Autogen framework. Let's dive in!IntroductionAre you tired of spending hours conducting research and compiling data? Do you wish you had a team of AI researchers that could assist you in extracting information and delivering high-quality research results? Look no further! In this tutorial, I will guide you through the process of building a multi-agent research system using GPT assistants and the Autogen framework. With this system, you can automate your research tasks and improve the quality and efficiency of your work.BackgroundBefore we dive into the details of building the research system, let's first understand the background and the motivation behind it. Research is a fundamental ability that AI can excel at, and it has a wide range of use cases. Over the past few years, AI development has been rapidly evolving, and new AI researchers with enhanced capabilities are being built regularly. These researchers can perform tasks such as conducting Google searches, browsing the internet, and generating reports based on the collected information.AI Researcher 2.0The initial version of the AI researcher, which we will refer to as AI Researcher 2.0, followed a linear process. It was a simple language model chain that could take a research topic as input, trigger a Google search, scrape relevant websites, and generate a report. While this version worked for simple research tasks, it had limitations. For example, if new information was found during the content scraping process, the researcher couldn't further research it. Additionally, it struggled with complex or constrained actions.Multi-Agent SystemsTo overcome the limitations of AI Researcher 2.0, multi-agent systems were introduced. These systems, such as MGBT and Chaddef, allowed multiple agents to work together to tackle more complex tasks. The Autogen framework made it easier to create and orchestrate the collaboration between different agents. With the introduction of the Assistant API and GBS by OpenAI, building useful agents became more accessible and cost-effective.Fine-TuningWhen training highly specialized agents, there are two common approaches: fine-tuning and knowledge base creation. Fine-tuning is used when you want to improve the model's skills in performing specific tasks, such as data categorization or answering customer emails. Gradient AI is a platform that simplifies the fine-tuning process and makes it accessible to all developers and enterprises. With Gradient AI, you can fine-tune high-performance open-source models without the need for specialized hardware or upfront infrastructure costs.Building the Research SystemNow that we have a clear understanding of the background and the tools at our disposal, let's start building the research system. We will create three different GPT assistants with different roles: the user proxy agent, the researcher, and the research manager. Each assistant will play a specific role in the research process, and we will use the Autogen framework to orchestrate their collaboration.Creating the Research AgentsThe first step is to create the research agents. We will start by creating the researcher agent, which will be responsible for browsing the internet and conducting research tasks. The researcher agent will be a GPT assistant with the ability to extract detailed information on any given topic and produce fact-based results. It will perform Google searches, script websites, and provide research references.Next, we will create the research manager agent. The research manager will review the results from the researcher and provide feedback and quality control. The research manager will generate research plans, review the research delivered by the researcher, and propose alternative methods if necessary. The research manager plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the research results.Finally, we will create the director agent. The director will extract a list of companies to research from an Air table and break it down into individual research tasks. The director will delegate these tasks to the research manager and the researcher. Once a company's research is completed, the director will update the company information in the Air table. The director agent ensures that the research tasks are organized and completed efficiently.Connecting the AgentsNow that we have created the research agents, it's time to connect them together using the Autogen framework. Autogen simplifies the usage of the Assistant API by providing a straightforward way to trigger messages and track progress. We will define the user proxy agent, the researcher agent, and the research manager agent. We will then create a group chat and add the agents to the chat. This will allow them to communicate and collaborate effectively.Expanding the SystemOne of the most exciting aspects of the research system is its ability to expand and accommodate more agents. You can introduce additional agents, such as a research director, who can break down large research goals into subtasks and delegate them to the research manager and the researcher. The system can also include agents with additional capabilities, such as reading and writing to an Air table to save research results. By expanding the system with more agents, you can enhance its capabilities and make it more autonomous.Training Specialized AgentsTraining specialized agents is crucial for improving the performance of the research system. There are two common approaches to training specialized agents: fine-tuning and knowledge base creation. Fine-tuning is used when you want to improve the model's skills in performing specific tasks. Gradient AI is a platform that simplifies the fine-tuning process and makes it accessible to all developers and enterprises. With Gradient AI, you can fine-tune high-performance open-source models without the need for specialized hardware or upfront infrastructure costs.Autogen FrameworkThe Autogen framework is a powerful tool for creating and orchestrating multi-agent systems. It provides a flexible and customizable way to define agent roles, trigger messages, and track progress. With Autogen, you can easily create different hierarchies and structures to orchestrate the collaboration between agents. The framework simplifies the usage of the Assistant API and makes it accessible to developers of all skill levels.Creating the Multi-Agent SystemNow that we have a clear understanding of the Autogen framework and its capabilities, let's create the multi-agent research system. We will define the user proxy agent, the researcher agent, the research manager agent, and the director agent. We will register the necessary functions for each agent, such as Google search, website scripting, and updating Air table records. By connecting these agents together, we can create a powerful and collaborative research system.Testing the SystemOnce the multi-agent system is set up, it's time to test its functionality. We can trigger messages to the group chat and observe how the agents collaborate and perform their tasks. We can provide input prompts and evaluate the quality of the research results. By testing the system, we can identify any issues or improvements that need to be made.Memory ChallengesOne of the challenges in building a multi-agent research system is managing memory.

However, these models primarily rely on system one thinking, which is fast and intuitive but lacks the ability to break down complex problems into smaller steps and explore different options. This limitation has led researchers to focus on developing GPT-5 with enhanced reasoning abilities and reliability.The Two Modes of ThinkingIn his book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" Daniel Kahneman introduces the concept of two modes of thinking: system one and system two. System one thinking is our fast, intuitive brain that quickly provides answers based on memorized information. On the other hand, system two thinking is slower but more rational, requiring us to take time, calculate, and analyze before arriving at an answer.Similarly, large language models like GPT-4 primarily rely on system one thinking.

Many of them answered incorrectly because they relied on system one thinking, providing automatic intuitive answers without truly considering the question.Large language models like GPT-4 face a similar challenge. They lack the ability to think critically and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. This is where GPT-5 comes in.The Promise of GPT-5GPT-5 aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models and introduce system two thinking. OpenAI's Sam Altman mentioned in an interview with Bill Gates that the key milestones for GPT-5 will be around reasoning ability and reliability.Currently, GPT-4 can reason in extremely limited ways and lacks reliability.

There are ways to enforce system two thinking in large language models today, even with GPT-4.Promoting System 2 Thinking in Large Language ModelsThere are two common strategies to promote system two thinking in large language models: prompt engineering and communicative agents.Prompt EngineeringPrompt engineering is a simple and common method to guide large language models towards system two thinking. One approach is the \"chain of thought,\" where a sentence is inserted step by step before the model generates any text. This forces the model to break down the problem into smaller steps and think through each one.Another approach is to provide a few short prompt examples instead of a step-by-step process. These examples guide the model towards thinking through different steps and considering multiple possibilities.While prompt engineering can be effective in promoting system two thinking, it has limitations.

SCCOT involves running the chain of thought process multiple times and reviewing and voting on the most reasonable answers.

It keeps track of all the paths explored and allows for backtracking if the current path doesn't lead to the desired outcome. However, implementing the tree of sorts is complex and requires significant implementation effort.Communicative AgentsCommunicative agents provide an elegant solution to promote system two thinking in large language models.
