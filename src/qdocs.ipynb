Each OTP process has the potential to prevent its siblings\\nand cousins from booting. If the process dies, it’s retried again, and again, until it works,\\nor fails too often.\\nThat’s where people make a very common mistake. There isn’t a backoﬀ or cooldown\\nperiod before a supervisor restarts a crashed child. When a network-based application tries\\nto set up a connection during its initialization phase and the remote service is down, the\\napplication fails to boot after too many fruitless restarts. Then the system may shut down.\\nMany Erlang developers end up arguing in favor of a supervisor that has a cooldown\\nperiod. I strongly oppose the sentiment for one simple reason: it’s all about the guarantees .\\n2.2.1 It’s About the Guarantees\\nRestarting a process is about bringing it back to a stable, known state. From there, things\\ncan be retried. When the initialization isn’t stable, supervision is worth very little. An\\ninitialized process should be stable no matter what happens. That way, when its siblings\\nand cousins get started later on, they can be booted fully knowing that the rest of the\\nsystem that came up before them is healthy.\\nIf you don’t provide that stable state, or if you were to start the entire system asyn-\\nchronously, you would get very little beneﬁt from this structure that a try ... catch in\\na loop wouldn’t provide.\\n6http://mononcqc.tumblr.com/post/35165909365/why-do-computers-stop'"

       "Document(page_content='Introduction\\nOn Running Software\\nThere’s something rather unique in Erlang in how it approaches failure compared to most\\nother programming languages. There’s this common way of thinking where the language,\\nprogramming environment, and methodology do everything possible to prevent errors.\\nSomething going wrong at run-time is something that needs to be prevented, and if it\\ncannot be prevented, then it’s out of scope for whatever solution people have been thinking\\nabout.\\nTheprogramiswrittenonce, andafterthat, it’soﬀtoproduction, whatevermayhappen\\nthere. If there are errors, new versions will need to be shipped.\\nErlang, on the other hand, takes the approach that failures will happen no matter what,\\nwhether they’re developer-, operator-, or hardware-related. It is rarely practical or even\\npossible to get rid of all errors in a program or a system.1If you can deal with some errors\\nrather than preventing them at all cost, then most undeﬁned behaviours of a program can\\ngo in that \"deal with it\" approach.\\nThis is where the \"Let it Crash\"2idea comes from: Because you can now deal with\\nfailure, and because the cost of weeding out all of the complex bugs from a system before\\nit hits production is often prohibitive, programmers should only deal with the errors they\\nknow how to handle, and leave the rest for another process (a supervisor) or the virtual\\nmachine to deal with.\\nGiven that most bugs are transient3, simply restarting processes back to a state known\\nto be stable when encountering an error can be a surprisingly good strategy.\\nErlang is a programming environment where the approach taken is equivalent to the\\nhuman body’s immune system, whereas most other languages only care about hygiene to\\nmake sure no germ enters the body. Both forms appear extremely important to me. Almost\\nevery environment oﬀers varying degrees of hygiene. Nearly no other environment oﬀers\\n1life-critical systems are usually excluded from this category\\n2Erlang people now seem to favour \"let it fail\", given it makes people far less nervous.\\n3131 out of 132 bugs are transient bugs (they’re non-deterministic and go away when you look at them,\\nand trying again may solve the problem entirely), according to Jim Gray in Why Do Computers Stop and\\nWhat Can Be Done About It?\\n1')"
